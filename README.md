# Solution
I have built the as per the level 1 requirements in react(this is kind of practice for me as I'm still new to ReactJS). The code for table and pagnation implementation was written from scratch and no external libraries were used for it(and yeah it took a lot of time :| )
 -- clone the repo with `git clone`
 -- change your current work directory with `cd </path/to/clone-folder-name>`
 -- install the dependencies with `npm install`
 -- run the project with `npm start`
